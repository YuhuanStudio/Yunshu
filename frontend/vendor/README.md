The pinned archive keeps the frontend reproducible without requiring a sibling
YunUI checkout or publishing an unreleased package. To update intentionally, build
YunUI, run `pnpm pack --pack-destination <Yunshu>/frontend/vendor`, update this
provenance, then regenerate the lockfile and run the console checks. Do not copy
individual controls into the application.
